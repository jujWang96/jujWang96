Hi, I’m Jue Wang. I am a fourth-year statistics Ph.D. candidate from UC Davis under the supervision of Thomas Lee. 

My research interests include image segmentation, image inpainting, spatial point data bootstrap and general machine learning domain. I have a strong interest in designing and implementing methodologies that solve real-life problems. Currently I am working with Vinay L. Kashyap from Harvard University and Andreas Zezas from University of Crete on developing a procedure to quantify the uncertainty of graph-based image segmentation algorithms. Besides, I also had multiple hands-on modeling and analysis experiences on projects including classification, image segmentation and natural language processing, which involve implementing and fine-tuning different machine learning architectures.
