Hi, I’m Jue Wang. I am a fifth-year statistics Ph.D. candidate from UC Davis under the supervision of Thomas Lee. I graduated from UC San Diego in 2018 with a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Math and a minor in Computer Science. 

My research interests include image segmentation, causal infernece, fairness and general machine learning domain. I have a strong interest in designing and implementing methodologies that solve real-life problems. I also had multiple hands-on modeling and analysis experiences on projects including classification, image segmentation and natural language processing, which involve implementing and fine-tuning different machine learning architectures.
